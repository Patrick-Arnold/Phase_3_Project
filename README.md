# Phase_3_Project
Predicting vaccine behavior

This project is a part of the [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/page/210/) competitions.  

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to predict whether people got the H1N1 vaccine using information that they shared about their backgrounds, opinions, and health behaviors. The stakeholder was chosen as the CDC so that their will be better preperation for the next COVID-19 like pandemic by targeting unvaccinated people based on the findings of the project. The overall goal of increasing the vaccination rate is to promote a healthier society by achieving herd immunity. 

### Methods Used

What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)

## Needs of this project
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting

## Getting Started
In order to get the dataset needed, we needed to sign up for the [competition] (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/data/).
